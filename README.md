Sass styles organised on SMACSS principles
==========================================

I like modular CSS, and I like [Jonathan Snook](https://twitter.com/@snookca)'s [Scalable and Modular CSS](http://smacss.com/) methodology. 

I also like CSS preprocessors and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) in particular.

These are pretty much empty files with comments, which may be of some use to someone, somewhere.
